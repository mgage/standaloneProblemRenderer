NAME    standalonePGproblemRenderer.plDESCRIPTION    This module provides functions for rendering html from files outside the    normal context of providing a webwork homework set user an existing    problem set.    It can be used to create a live version of a single problem, one that is    not part of any set, and can facilitate editing these problems outside    of the context of WeBWorK2.    This script will take a list of files or directories and send it to a    WeBWorK daemon webservice to have it rendered. For directories each .pg    file under that directory is rendered.    The results can be displayed in a browser (use -b or -B switches) as was    done with renderProblem.pl, on the command line (Use -h or -H switches)    as was done with renderProblem_rawoutput.pl or summary information about    whether the problem was correctly rendered can be sent to a log file    (use -c or C switches).    The capital letter switches, -B, -H, and -C render the question twice.    The first time returns an answer hash which contains the correct    answers. The question is then resubmitted to the renderer with the    correct answers filled in and displayed.SYNOPSIS            standalonePGproblemRenderer -vcCbB input.pgDETAILS	No local configuration file is needed for this client.  Options    -a                Displays the answer hashes returned by the question on the command line.    -A                Same as -a but renders the question with the correct answers submitted.    -b                Display the rendered question in a browser (specified by the DISPLAY_HTML_COMMAND variable).    -B                Same as -b but renders the question with the correct answers submitted.                 The evaluation of the answer submitted is displayed as well as the correct                answer.    -h                Prints to the command line the entire object returned by             the webwork_client xmlrpc request.            This includes the answer information displayed by -a and -A and much more.    -H                Same as -h but renders the question with the correct answers submitted    -c                "check" -- Record success or failure of rendering the question to a log file.    -C                Same as -c but the question is rendered with the correct answers submitted.             This succeeds only if the correct answers, as determined from the answer hash, all succeed.    f=s                Specify the format used by the browser in displaying the question.                  Choices for s are                 standard                 sticky                 debug                  simple    -v                Verbose output. Used mostly for debugging.             In particular it displays explicitly the correct answers             which are (will be)  submitted to the question.    -e Open the source file in an editor.                The single letter options can be "bundled" e.g.  -vcCbB    --list pg_list Read and process a list of .pg files contained in the    file "pg_list". "pg_list" consists of a sequence of lines each of which    contains the full path to a pg file that should be processed. (For    example this might be the output from an earlier run of sendXMLRPC using    the -c flag. )    --pg                Triggers the printing of the all of the variables available to the PG question.             The table appears within the question content. Use in conjunction with -b or -B.    --anshash                Prints the answer hash for each answer in the PG_debug output which appears below            the question content. Use in conjunction with -b or -B.             Similar to -a or -A but the output appears in the browser and             not on the command line.    --ansgrp                Prints the PGanswergroup for each answer evaluator. The information appears in             the PG_debug output which follows the question content.  Use in conjunction with -b or -B.            This contains more information than printing the answer hash. (perhaps too much).    --credentials=s                Specifies a file s where the  credential information can be found.    --help               Prints help information.
